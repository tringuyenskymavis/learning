Its not just about the job or the money. Its about who I am gonna be and how far I can go on this journey.

After over a year in this industry, I have chasing the technology all the time. I have learned a lot of things, and I have achieved some of my goals.

In that journey, I have met a lot of good people, and I am grateful for that. Some teach me the knowledge, some show me the experience.

Going through a lot of things, I realized that in this industry, sometimes the speed to adapt new technology, new concept is important. But the safety is the most important thing. A smart contract developer sometimes does not care about the security of the code. Sometimes they care about how to ship the feature as fast as possible. And sometimes bad things happen.

Because of that, I want to slowing down and focus on the security aspect. You can adapt the new technology later when you have enough knowledge about the security. That is the reason I join the course.

At the end of the course, I want to be so fuking good at smart contract development. I can develop any kind of contracts without scaring about my contracts gonna get hacked and exploited. Then I got fired.

And the most important thing is that I want to have money to make my family proud and make my life more independent.
